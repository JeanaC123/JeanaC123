## 🌿 About Me
I'm a Software Systems major at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, with a minor in Creative Writing. I’m interested in building software that’s technically solid, thoughtfully designed, and easy for others to understand.

Right now, I'm focused on strengthening my foundations and building toward larger, portfolio-level work.

## 🌿 Current Work
- **Senior Capstone Project (in progress)**

  I'm current working on my senior capstone, and I'll be adding more details here as the project develops.

- **Smaller Projects**
  - Forest Focus: a forest-themed Pomodoro timer (in progress)
  - Tidy Folder: a C++ folder organizer utility (in progress)
  
  More coming soon ❤️. 

- **Skill Building & Practice**

  Alongside coursework, I'm actively refining my programmign skills and working on personal growth in:
  - Python
  - Java
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript
  - C++
  - C#

## 🌿 What's Coming Next
Over time, I’m hoping to grow this GitHub into a space that reflects the work I’m most proud of. Along with my capstone project, I want to build smaller, focused projects that demonstrate my grasp of the languages I’m learning.

My goal is to create things that are simple, functional, and genuinely useful, whether that’s for my own workflow or for others who might come across them.

As I continue learning, I’ll be adding more polished projects, documentation, and long-term work here.

## 🌿 Youtube
I'll also be posting more consistently on Youtube, showing coding progress, project walthroughs, and some gaming content.
